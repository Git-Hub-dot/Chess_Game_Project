## ♟<u> **Online Chess Game**</u>
An interactive online chess game built by **Saroj Dhital** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project offers a visually polished chessboard with smooth animations, legal move handling, and a user-friendly design that works on both desktop and mobile.
***
## 🛠️ <u>**Technologies Used:**</u>
● **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Grid & Flexbox for layout, modern styling with highlights and shadows)

● **Logic**: JavaScript (handles chess rules, move validation, and gameplay flow)
***
## ✨ <u>**Features:**</u>
✅ Full chessboard with all standard pieces and setup

✅ Handles legal moves (pawns, rooks, bishops, knights, queen, king)

✅ Turn-based gameplay (White vs. Black)

✅ Move validation (no illegal moves allowed)

✅ Check and checkmate detection (basic implementation)

✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile

✅ Smooth hover and click animations

✅ Clear, readable UI with highlighted moves
***
## 🚀 <u>**How It Works:**</u>
1. Open the game in the browser.
2. White moves first, then players alternate turns.
3. Pieces follow standard chess movement rules.
4. The game ends when one king is checkmated.
5. Highlighted squares help guide legal moves.
